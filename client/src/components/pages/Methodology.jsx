              Bulk ownership is defined as 10 or more properties. We pull all
              owners of ten or more properties from the City of Detroit Assessor
              Data. We update the assessor data with Wayne County Tax
              Foreclosure sales as these are not currently included in the
              Assessor data. We manually review corporation filings with the
              State of Michigan or the state in which Limited Liability
              Corporations are incorporated. From these records we identify
              company ownership. We sample property conditions for owners
              utilizing Google Street View.
